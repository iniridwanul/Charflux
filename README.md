# Charflux
**Charflux** is a simple C program that takes a password as input and performs basic encryption by incrementing the ASCII value of each character by 1. The encrypted password is then displayed as output.

## Features
- Accepts a password input from the user.
- Encrypts the password by incrementing each character's ASCII value by 1.
- Displays the encrypted password.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user for a password.
2. It encrypts the password by iterating through each character and increasing its ASCII value by 1.
3. The encrypted password is displayed on the screen.

### Example:
- **Input**: `charflux`
- **Encrypted Output**: `dibsgmvy`

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g. GCC)
